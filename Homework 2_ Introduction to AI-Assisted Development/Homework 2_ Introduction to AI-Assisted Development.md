# Homework 2: End-to-End Application Development

In this homework, we'll build an end-to-end application with AI.

You can use any tool you want: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.

With chat-based applications you will need to copy code back-and-forth, so we recommend that you use an AI assistant in your IDE with agent mode.

We will implement a platform for online coding interviews.

The app should be able to do the following:

- Create a link and share it with candidates
- Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
- Show real-time updates to all connected users
- Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Execute code safely in the browser

You can choose any technologies you want. For example:

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Express.js

We recommend using JavaScript for frontend, because with other technologies, some of the homework requirements may be difficult to implement.

But you can experiment with alternatives, such as Streamlit.

You don't need to know these technologies for doing this homework.


## Question 1: Initial Implementation

Ask AI to implement both frontend and backend - in one prompt.

Note: you can also follow the same path as in the videos and make it in 3 steps:

1. Frontend
2. OpenAPI specs
3. Backend

What's the initial prompt you gave to AI to start the implementation?

Copy and paste it in the homework form.

### Answer 1:

```bash
pip install django
```
